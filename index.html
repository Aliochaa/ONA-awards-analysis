        <!-- <h1>How news organisations have performed at the ONA Awards</h1> -->
        <p>Since 2000, the Online Journalism Awards (OJAs) have honored excellence in digital journalism around the world.</p>
        <p>According to the ONA website, <em>"the OJAs have recognized major media, international and independent sites and individuals producing innovative work in multimedia storytelling. The OJA Committee and judges place special emphasis on entries that demonstrate mastery of the special characteristics and emerging technology of digital journalism."</em></p>
        <p><strong>Related:</strong> Rediscover the last 14 years of OJA finalists and winners using <a href="http://newsroom14.journalists.org/?p=751" target="_blank" />our ONA AwardsBot</a>. A special thanks to the designers and coders Sisi Wei and Jeremy Bowers!
        </p>
        <h2>The New York Times dominates award counts ...</h2>
        <p>There are many ways to evaluate an organization's performance at the OJAs. If we count awards, the New York Times dominates the results with as many wins as the second- and third-place organizations combined.</p>
        <div id="ranking1"></div>
        <p class="note">Note: Organizations are only shown if they have won at least three OJA awards since 2000.</p>
        <h2>... but their performance is only average when it comes to winning awards.</h2>
        <p>Looking at OJA finalists since 2000, the median organization wins an award about every three times they are at least a finalist. The Times has performed no better than average in this respect. Comparatively, CBC News, WNYC and the National Film Board of Canada have won many more awards than expected.</p>
        <div id="ranking2"></div>
        <p class="note">Note: Organizations are only shown if they have won at least three OJA awards since 2000. The median organization (red line) wins an award 33.3 percent of the time that they are a finalist.</p>

        <h2>The number of awards given has nearly tripled since 2000.</h2>
        <div id="awards_amount"></div>
        <h2>Over 14 years, 488 organizations have been OJA finalists.</h2>
        <div id="explore_container">
            <table id="explore" class="display" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Media</th>
                        <th>Finalist</th>
                        <th>Winner</th>

                    </tr>
                </thead>
            </table>
        </div>
        <h2>Sadly, many links to finalist and winning projects are now broken.</h2>
        <div id="errors"></div>
        <h2>How we got the data</h2>
        <p>
            The complete official list of finalists and awarded is available on <a href="http://journalists.org/awards/2014-finalists/" target="_blank">the ONA website</a>. After a web scraping and a big cleaning task, we got a list of 1230 pieces of work on a spreadsheet. It's available <a href="https://github.com/Aliochaa/ONA-awards-analysis/blob/master/data/ONA%20awards.csv" target="_blank">here</a> but <strong>be careful</strong>, reconciling data could have generated some small errors and finalists's awards titles aren't displayed. We used a Python script to automatically test every link.
        </p>
        <p>
            The charts only represent media with at least 3 awards won.
